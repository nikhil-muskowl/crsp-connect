          <p>Inventory Management is a key element in deciding the revenue and sales forecasts where excess or lack of
            inventory can turn out to be a significant disadvantage for your business. Inventory Management includes
            basic services such as ensuring smooth distribution, delivery and stocking products in a way that optimizes
            given storage space. Apart from this, inventory management also involves forecasting which items will
            generate most sales and determining optimal quantities of each item in storage.</p>
